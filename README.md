# Memes Suggestorminator

As the name suggest, this is the effort to create a BOT to "track your conversation history" and provide memes as it fits the scenario.

Ideally, it will run on a user's collection of memes, each meme will be tag with a certain tags/vectors. The meme database can either be manually created or AI generated based on AI vision model.

Then, the context of the conversation will be feed into a LLM model to detect for a theme, and a meme will be selected accordingly.

# How will this project works?

Basically, this will be three phases:
1. Create an AI bot that when receive a conversation history will provide an approximately fitting reply, which could be then used for meme choosing.
2. A database of memes, with proper labeling to match with the reply of the bot
3. An interface to connect everything, and providing maintenanace/adding more memes/put in conversation history

# What are the limit of this project?

1. Only local. No web embed, no cloud, nothing.
2. As small as possible, I want it to be a funny side stuffs, not taking 60% of your CPU and 10GB of your RAM.

Basically that's it. Will update more whenever I have something else.
